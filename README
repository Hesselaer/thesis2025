Files needed for a bachelor thesis at LIACS, the Computer
Science department of Leiden University.

Five files:
thesis.tex         the main LaTeX file
titlepage.tex      the frontpage
bibliography.bib   the references
marxbrothers2.jpg  just some JPG image
logoleiden.pdf     logo Leiden University

The files are rather self-explanatory.

In order to process all this, use www.overleaf.com,
put all five files in one directory, and press Recompile.

Or, on a Linux machine, use:
  pdflatex thesis
  bibtex thesis
  pdflatex thesis
  pdflatex thesis

Or use MiKTeX and friends on a Windows machine.
